            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Hey! Did you know that i'm a huge(I'm also physically huge I'm 12 and 5'6 and really strong.) sports person?! Well now you do, I'm gonna tell 
                you all about my love for sports, what sports i've played, and my accomplishments in sports. TENNIS- Tennis is my primary sport,
                i've been playing it for 6 years and i'm really good at it. I was introduced to the sport by my dad, at first I just played so my 
                dad would stop asking me to, then I fell in love with the sport. Now i'm known in the area for tennis! I've been playing tournamnet for 
                2 and a 1/2 years now, i've won 4 tournamnets and been a finalist 3 times. SHOTPUT- I just started shot put 1 month ago, and i'm already
                really good at it! My highest is about 25ft, I got 1st in the whole district for shotput! TRACK AND FIELD- Not my favourite, but I still
                like it. I only do one running event in track, and it's the 100 meter dash. Because I'm really good at sprinting, long distance
                kills me :') In my heat, I got first place. My best time is 14:32 I think. So now as you can see, I'm a gifted athlete!(or atleast I think I am) 
                There are some videos below that you can watch, you can learn and enjoy.

            <p>Now let's learn more about me, I'm Jhanvi, I was born on feb 1st 2011 in Tacoma Washington. I like sports, big cities, shopping, and so much more!</p>

            <p> PERSONALITY- I've been asking people what my personality is like, and here's what they have said:
                MOM-"when when you decide to do something, ur stuck to it. But when ur not so intrested in something, you let go way too easily."
                DAD-"ur low on confidence but very smart."
                BROTHER-"Funny. JUST FUNNY."" (he's 6 he probably doesn't really know what he's saying)
                BEST FRIEND- "Jhanvi is great goofy, protective, and sporty person. Who never lets anyone say anything about her, because she has great verbal defense"
                In the end, I don't think anyone could find out what personality I had, or what the wole point of that whole data collection was, but I think that we get the idea
                of who I am now.
                FAVOURITE FOODS- After a lot of thinking, I can now finally say what my favourite food is- BUTTER CHICKEN WITH NAAN/JEERA RICE!!! And my favourite drink is BOBA!!!
                I love Asian food, i've lost my taste for American food because of how flavourless it is! BUT, I will never stop loving American sweets, they taste soooooo good, but Asian sweets are still better!!!</p>

                         <p>INTRESTS- I have other intrests besides sports, like coding👩🏾‍💻,drawing🖊✏, and putting on makeup💄💅🏾 for fun! 
                            I really like coding because you can create creally cool things, because all the apps and websites we use, have been created by coding.
                            I want to someday become a software engineer at a big company like Boeing or Microsoft, and the neat part is that both those places are about less than 75 miles away 
                             from where I live. I really like drawing because it's fun and stress relieving. I really like botanical drawings🌼🌸🌺, flowers look really pretty
                             when drawn, especially with water colours. I like putting on makeup for fun because it's really cool how pretty I can make myself look with just
                             one mascara, lipgloss, and foundation! I know that I will epicly fail trying to put on eyeliner but I always still try to put it on. Sometimes I like 
                             to imagine that i'm a professional makeup artist and that i'm putting makeup on a client. </p>

                             <p>🏫SCHOOL🏫-I go to Thurgood Marshall Middle School, or TMMS. I'm now going to be in 7th grade. I'm not entirely sure of what my schedule will be this school year, but I hope that 
                                science isn't as boring as it was this year. My favourite subject is either math or social studies. So far I know that I will have orchestra,
                                science, social studies,ela, and math in my schedule. I'm already having nightmares of going back...
